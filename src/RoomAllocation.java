/**
 * There is a large hotel, and n customers will arrive soon. Each customer wants to have a single room.
 * You know each customer's arrival and departure day.
 * Two customers can stay in the same room if the departure day of the first customer is earlier than the arrival day of the second customer.
 *
 * What is the minimum number of rooms that are needed to accommodate all customers? And how can the rooms be allocated?
 *
 * Input
 *
 * The first input line contains an integer n: the number of customers.
 * Then there are n lines, each of which describes one customer. Each line has two integers a and b: the arrival and departure day.
 *
 * Output
 *
 * Print first an integer k: the minimum number of rooms required.
 * After that, print a line that contains the room number of each customer in the same order as in the input.
 * The rooms are numbered 1,2,â€¦,k.
