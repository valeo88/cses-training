/**
 *
 You have to process n tasks. Each task has a duration and a deadline,
 and you will process the tasks in some order one after another.
 Your reward for a task is dâˆ’f where d is its deadline and f is your finishing time.
 (The starting time is 0, and you have to process all tasks even if a task would yield negative reward.)

 What is your maximum reward if you act optimally?

 Input

 The first input line has an integer n: the number of tasks.
 After this, there are n lines that describe the tasks. Each line has two integers a and d: the duration and deadline of the task.

 Output

 Print one integer: the maximum reward.
