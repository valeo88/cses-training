 *
 * On each turn, you may increase the value of any element by one.
 * What is the minimum number of turns required?
 *
 * Input
 *
 * The first input line contains an integer n: the size of the array.
 *
 * Then, the second line contains n integers x1,x2,â€¦,xn: the contents of the array.

 * Output
 *
 * Print the minimum number of turns.
